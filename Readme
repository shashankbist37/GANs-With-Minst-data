# GAN Implementation on MNIST Dataset

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a conditional-GAN (c-GAN) on the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to generate realistic images of digits, with a user interface that allows the user to specify a digit for image generation.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment involves the following key tasks:

1. **Research:** Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and conditional-GANs.
2. **Implementation:** Building a c-GAN for generating images of digits using the MNIST dataset.
3. **Experimentation:** Playing around with various model parameters and neural network architectures.
4. **Analysis:** Evaluating how adjustments impact the quality of the generated images.
5. **User Input:** Allowing the user to input a digit value and generating an image accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure
- `gan.py`: Implementation of the GAN and c-GAN models.
- `train_gan.py`: Training script for the GAN model.
- `generate_image.py`: User interface script for generating images based on user input.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions, and key findings.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-mnist.git
    cd gan-mnist
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Train the GAN Model:**
    ```bash
    python train_gan.py
    ```

4. **Generate Images:**
    ```bash
    python generate_image.py
    ```
    Follow the prompts to input a digit and observe the generated image.
